# Project-Noobical
This project allows you to make files, folders and shutdown your computer etc,  with just 1 or 2 clicks with your phone. This app is now only avaliable for android, this is a beta version, and the pc application is only supported for 64 bit. There maybe some bugs and glitches and maybe the android app will not support devices with low resolution.
Thank you for using this project!
